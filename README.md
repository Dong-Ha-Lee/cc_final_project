# cc_final_project
Project Statement - This project is to encourage and educate public on protecting endangered species especially polar bears.
The game demonstrates a polar bear's part of life where she has to survive through melting and breaking iceplates which will make holes on where the
polar bear stands. The bear will die if she falls into the hole and the ending page will direct the user to a crowdfunding page.

Goals:
- Sucessful use of Weather API
- Fully animated game
- Sucessful use of comment
- Creating a state machine
- Keep up with the dates I set
